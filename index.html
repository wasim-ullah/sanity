    <h2>Safe Superintelligence Inc.</h2>
    <p><b>Superintelligence is within reach.</b></p>
    <p>Building safe superintelligence (SSI) is the most important
    technical problem of our​​ time.</p>
    <p>We have started the world’s first straight-shot SSI lab,
    with one goal and one product: a safe superintelligence.</p>
    <p>It’s called Safe Superintelligence Inc.</p>
    <p>SSI is our mission, our name, and our entire product
    roadmap, because it is our sole focus. Our team, investors, and
    business model are all aligned to achieve SSI.</p>
    <p>We approach safety and capabilities in tandem, as technical
    problems to be solved through revolutionary engineering and
    scientific breakthroughs. We plan to advance capabilities as
    fast as possible while making sure our safety always remains
    ahead.</p>
    <p>This way, we can scale in peace.</p>
    <p>Our singular focus means no distraction by management
    overhead or product cycles, and our business model means
    safety, security, and progress are all insulated from
    short-term commercial pressures.</p>
    <p>We are an American company with offices in Palo Alto and Tel
    Aviv, where we have deep roots and the ability to recruit top
    technical talent.</p>
    <p>We are assembling a lean, cracked team of the world’s best
    engineers and researchers dedicated to focusing on SSI and
    nothing else.</p>
    <p>If that’s you, we offer an opportunity to do your life’s
    work and help solve the most important technical challenge of
    our age.</p>
    <p>Now is the time. Join us.<br>
